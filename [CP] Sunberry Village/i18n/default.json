The Weather Goddess was asked to bless them with good weather so their hard work wouldn't get ruined, while the Fruit Goddess was asked to bless them with fruits to keep them sustained...#The goddesses, despite being in love, maintained their lighthearted rivalry amongst the humans. Through the time spent, strong bonds were formed with each other, and with the humans. Finally, the village was stable enough for the goddesses to reveal their identities to the humans. The humans rejoiced and thanked them for all the help they provided...#The goddesses left the villagers with one final blessing: Sunberries.
