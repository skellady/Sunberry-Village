    "MapString.GoddessLorePart1": "\"The Goddesses of Sunberry Village, Part 1:\"^^Many eons ago, gods and goddesses walked the earth amongst us humans.^^This is the legend of two such deities: the goddess of fruit, Tamra, and the goddess of weather, Shumus. Both goddesses loved the humans, and were in turn loved by them.^^^^(Part 1 cont.)^^The two goddesses took great joy in engaging in a competition for the humans' affection, each determined to prove that they were more essential to the wellbeing of humans than the other.^^But there was always an undercurrent of playful teasing to their debates, and it was plain to see that they were very fond of one another...",
    "MapString.GoddessLorePart2": "\"The Goddesses of Sunberry Village, Part 2:\"^^One day, a great calamity sundered the earth, and water poured forth from the chasm, channeling the land into continents divided by vast oceans.^^The goddesses were trapped on opposite sides of the waters, and they were distraught at the realization that they were separated from one another. Too late, they realized that they had come to love each other deeply.^^^^(Part 2 cont.)^^Heartbroken, Shumus poured her grief into songs of lost love which she sent across the water using her power over wind, but Tamra could only listen to them and weep, having no way to return the message...",
    "MapString.GoddessLorePart3": "\"The Goddesses of Sunberry Village, Part 3:\"^^As time passed, the songs of the weather goddess became shorter and less frequent. Her heart grew hard and cold, and with it the weather in turn grew harsh and frigid.^^She turned her eyes away from the hardships of the humans, but they persevered and innovated, creating new technologies to help them through these hard times.^^(Part 3 cont.)^^When they developed ships that could cross the vast oceans in search of more habitable lands, the goddess of fruit saw her chance, and pleaded with the villagers to let her join them on their voyage.^^They agreed at once, happy to have a goddess aboard, protecting them on what promised to be a difficult journey...",
    "MapString.GoddessLorePart4": "\"The Goddesses of Sunberry Village, Part 4:\"^^The ship sailed for many days and nights with the goddess always at the prow, searching for any sign of her beloved. Suddenly on one dark night, they were beset by a raging tempest that threatened to dash the ship to pieces!^^Tamra tried to hold back the worst of the storm, but when she heard a keening wail being carried on the wind she understood at once.^^(Part 4 cont.)^^Crossing the ship to the captain, she ordered him to sail directly into the storm.^^He was as furious as he was terrified, but the goddess had protected his voyage up to this point, so he relented to her demands and turned the wheel to point the ship directly into the storm. The crew worked tireless and the ship made slow but steady progress towards the source of the violent winds...",
    "MapString.GoddessLorePart5": "\"The Goddesses of Sunberry Village, Part 5:\"^^After what felt like an eternity of battling icy winds and choppy ocean waves, the crew sighted land, and their battered ship limped into a secluded cove.^^The ship had barely run aground before the goddess was vaulting over the railing and struggling against the powerful winds, making her way towards the center of the island.^^^^(Part 5 cont.)^^After traveling for several hours, she was freezing and exhausted.^^It was getting more and more difficult to continue the closer she came to the center of the storm. Tamra almost gave up at times, but when she listened carefully, she could hear her lover's cries on the wind. The thought of their reunion filled Tamra with energy and so she carried on.^^^^(Part 5 cont.)^^Finally, she emerged into a clearing, and the sight she beheld brought her to tears: her love, Shumus, knelt in the center of the clearing, frozen completely solid.^^There were no signs of life except for a mournful cry softly issuing from her icy lips, which grew as it left the clearing, forming the gusts of wind which scoured the island...",
    "MapString.GoddessLorePart6": "\"The Goddesses of Sunberry Village, Part 6:\"^^Tamra took the frozen figure into her arms, pressing her lips to her beloved as her tears rolled down her cheeks and froze where they touched Shumus' skin.^^Suddenly, she felt a faint warmth emanating from within Shumus, and she laughed in relief as the weather goddess stirred, shaking off the ice, and returned her kiss.^^^^(Part 6 cont.)^^As they embraced, the goddesses declared their love for each other, and vowed then and there to never leave one another's side again.^^Hearing a sound, they turned to see the ship's crew stumbling into the clearing, having followed the trail of lush grass that sprung from Tamra's footsteps.^^^^(Part 6 cont.)^^The humans looked around, stunned, as the weather began to clear. The summer sun shone down on them for what felt like the first time in ages, and the temperature started to rise.^^Shumus was devastated as she realized the hardships she had wrought upon humanity, and she swore she would never put them through such pain again...",
    "MapString.GoddessLorePart7": "\"The Goddesses of Sunberry Village, Part 7:\"^^The clearing where the goddesses had reunited became the center of a thriving village over the years, with the goddesses residing there and watching over the humans.^^As time passed, however, deities all over the world found that their presence waned and it became harder to walk amongst the humans, and they decided at last that it was time for them to depart.^^^^(Part 7 cont.)^^Before leaving, the two goddesses made the villagers one last promise: As long as they continued to look after one another and treat the land with respect, they would be blessed with fertile soil, sunny weather, and good fortune.^^As a symbol of this promise, they brought the last of their powers together to create their final blessing: the humble sunberry.^ ^^^^^                      The End",
    "MapString.GoddessLoreAuthorsNote": "Note from the Author:^^Today, it is hotly debated whether or not these legends have any truth to them.^^I myself believe that every story contains a kernel of truth. After all, geological records indicate multiple ice ages in our planet's history, and current patterns of continental drift seem to suggest that at one point, all the continents were joined into one great landmass.^^ ^Who's to say whether there were or weren't beings of immense power walking about amongst our early ancestors? Experiencing love, and loss, and everything else life has to offer?^^To quote my favorite show, The Z-Files, \"I want to believe\".^^                                      - S. Salacia",
    "MapString.sbv.library1": "\"The Crystal Cavern, Part 1\"^^The Crystal Cavern was discovered a few decades ago after a few noise complaints from the shack right above it. Some described the noises as haunting, uncanny, sinister... Little did they know, a cave existed right below that spot.^^The further we descended, the less we knew. Every time we thought we understood something, a new thing would pop up to debunk our theories...^^We'd need a bigger, more experienced team to truly uncover this place's secrets.^^-Dr. Zahra Y.",
    "MapString.sbv.library2": "Theres a torn up page poking out of this book.#\"Were the dwarves involved in the caves before the goddesses showed up?

Could the Abominations be linked to them?\"",
    "MapString.sbv.library3": "\"Mischief and Misfortune\"^^The group gathered around the table, working through their plans for the next mission. Eerie whispered, \"Can we just set it on fire?\".^^Everyone sighed with the exception of Salacia, Ausbird, and Wizciel, who were eagerly nodding in agreement. \"It's always fire with you three, isn't it?\" Jat mumbled.^^Wild Mushy raised her hand before saying, \"I'm always on board with setting things on fire, too.\"^^-Maxine O.",
    "MapString.sbv.library4": "\"Mysteries of the Forest\"^^The Sunberry Forest holds many secrets and supernatural elements that we've yet to completely uncover and study. It's not dangerous, per se, but it's eerie. The lushness of the forest hides secret pathways, a few of which we've found, but we can never be certain if there are more.^^-Dr. Zahra Y.",
    "MapString.sbv.library5": "\"The mysterious animal makes its appearance at night on rainy days. We're unsure of its nature, but it seems almost... fictitious... mythical, even. Its horns are adorned with what looks like rounded, brightly colored berries, its eyes glowing a deep yellow when lightning strikes...\"",
    "MapString.sbv.library6": "\"In the Depths, Part 1\"^^The cave has existed for longer than we thought. We're not sure how deep it goes, exactly, but these monsters... We've never seen anything like them before. The guild hasn't, either. We're thinking they may be abominations, experiments gone wrong...^^-Dr. Zahra Y.",
    "MapString.sbv.library7": "\"The Crystal Cavern, Part 2\"^^We've noticed a few locations in the caves that were monster-free. Our team took refuge in there if it got too late. On one of the levels, we ran into a beautiful, golden tree... unlike anything we've ever seen. It seemed to be producing some kind of gem, scattered all around it.^^Despite our discoveries, we have never managed to get to the bottom out of fear of losing any of our people. Our attempts have proven futile...^^-Dr. Zahra Y.",
    "MapString.sbv.library8": "\"In the Depths, Part 2\"^^A quick look at these monsters tells us a few things. One, they are nothing like the monsters in the Pelican Town mines. Two, they drop precious minerals upon perishing. Sometimes, they drop a delicate pink leaf.^^It doesn't seem to have any nutritional value, but it seems to be powerful. We'll keep experimenting to find any uses for these drops.^^The team's witch believes they can be used to brew potions, somehow.^^-Dr. Zahra Y.",
    "MapString.sbv.library9": "\"In the Depths, Part 3\"^^We've managed to study and name a few of the monsters we've come across. Crystal Menaces, Crystal Golems, and the Abominations. The most curious of all remain the Abominations. One of our scientists has managed to link them to the dwarves. They were used as sentries to keep intruders away, but eventually evolved into what they are now: Abominations. We haven't seen any proof of the dwarves' existence for centuries now. Hence, our investigation has led us to a dead end.^^-Dr. Zahra Y.",

    "Festivals.Luau.Iman": "Okay, this better be good. Marnie's been stirring it for a hot minute now. If it isn't, then at least I left the house for some fresh air.$u",

    "Festivals.Luau.Lyenne": "Blake is watching Sam to make sure he doesn't pull yet another prank. Poor guy's probably starving, he REALLY wants this soup to be good.$u",

    "Festivals.Luau.Miyoung": "This soup is going to be delicious! I added something from my little garden. It should complement the flower Jumana's adding for that tangy taste.$7",
    "Festivals.Luau.Moon": "Moon doesn't like soup.$s#$b#Moon goes fishing for food!$u",

    "LegendaryFishHintBook": " ^[The first section of the book is barely legible, the aged ink long having smeared and run. However, you quickly spot the section that caught Elias' attention.]^^In my travels, I came across an elderly fisherwoman in a pub who promised me a good yarn in exchange for something to quench her thirst. I bought the lady a drink, and in return she regaled me with stories of her youth spent aboard fishing boats all up and down the coast. A steely glint came into her eye as she recounted tales of the only two fish ever to best her, both situated in the distant hamlet known as Sunberry Village.^^The first she discovered deep in the mines there after having tagged along for a small expedition; there had recently been a cave-in and the townspeople wanted to assess the safety of continuing operations there.^^They came across an underground lake which she initially thought devoid of life, until she saw a monstrous shadow circling under the murky waters. She described it as 'slithering endlessly about its nest within the purple and gold saplings which grew there, as if seeking something it had no hope of finding'.^^(Privately, I dismissed this as the poetic soul of an old lady who spent more time alone at sea than she did around other people.)^^The second fish she came across in the autumn. While exploring deep in the forest south of the village, she came across a small grove, hidden well and teeming with dangerous creatures. She spotted something glimmering in the center of the pool and waded in to investigate, only to find herself beset upon by an enormous anglerfish.^^(I objected to this as anglerfish are saltwater creatures, but she said it must have been stranded there during a storm.)^^The local wildlife was riled up by the commotion and she was forced to flee, never getting a chance to try to catch the creature. It's no doubt long since dead, but I wouldn't be surprised if its progeny still lurk those waters.^^[The remainder of the book describes the old woman and the narrator getting increasingly inebriated and executing a wildly improbable series of stunts that resulted in both of them being exiled from the Ferngill Republic.]"
